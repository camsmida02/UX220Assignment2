### Recreational Soccer
1.
Playing soccer with my friends in a recreational league.

2.
So far I've been playing recreational soccer with my friends the past 3 summers.

3.
What I've enjoyed the most has been reconnecting with my friends each summer because often times I find myself really busy with work so its a great opportunity to meet with them.

4.
My favourite memory so far has been when we played a semi-final of a tournament where we almost won but sadly lost due to a rigged penalty last minute. 

5.
The thing I enjoyed the least has to be poor officiating in the league.
