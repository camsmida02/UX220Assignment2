### Vancouver Whitecaps Academy Soccer
1.
Joined the Vancouver Whitecaps soccer academy that was a grassroots project in London, ON.

This was back when I was in grade 7 in 2014.

What I enjoyed the most about it was the quality of play. A big change from the club soccer I came from and it was really challenging which I liked.

My favourite memory has to be reconnecting with some old teammates that I used to play futsal with when I was super young. I hadn't seen them for years before I joined the academy so it was great to see them again.

5.
What I enjoyed the least was the coach I had. Not a great person which made me decide to quit that team and re-join my friends back at my home club.
