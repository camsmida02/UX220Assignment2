### My First Job
1.
My first job was sorting through recycling in a factory in my hometown.

2.
I got this job beginning of grade 11 back in 2018.

3.
What I enjoyed the most was making money obviously but also I meet a lot of great people along the way.

4.
My favourite memory is probably the Christmas dinner that my company hosted at the Mandarin buffet. 

5.
The thing I enjoyed the least definitely was picking through recycling. Something I learned was that people really don't know how to recycle so I've made it my mission to recycle the best I can because of my experience working there.
